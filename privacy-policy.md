Overview:
TabTrack is a Chrome extension that allows users to save, restore, and manage their browser tab sessions. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparent data practices.

Data Collection and Storage:
TabTrack collects and stores the following information locally on your device using Chrome's storage API:
- Names of saved sessions (as provided by you)
- URLs and titles of tabs in your saved sessions
- Timestamps of when sessions were saved

All data is stored locally on your device. TabTrack does not transmit any data to external servers, nor does it share any data with third parties.

Permissions Used:
- "tabs": Required to access information about your open tabs when you choose to save a session
- "storage": Required to store your saved sessions locally on your device
- "downloads": Required for the export functionality when you choose to export your sessions

Data Security:
Since all data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's built-in storage API, the security of your data is managed by your browser's security mechanisms.

Data Retention:
Your saved sessions remain stored on your device until you delete them using the extension's interface or uninstall the extension.
